### About the Boston

[The Boston](https://github.com/bluepylons/Boston) is a compact 120% keyboard made by Pylon. There was never a real GB of the metal case, so Pylon was so very kind and opensourced the complete Board. There was a GB of a case specifically designed for 3D printing, but I didnt like the design and compromise of a split case.

So I took the metal version and optimized it for printing:
- Removed a lot of material on the inside to save on print time and cost (Alubutyl/Killmat is recommended to put in the inside of the case)
- Added a map of Boston to the underside, inspired by the FR4-version of the Boston. This was a pain to make, because Fusion becomes extremly slow with big SVGs.
- Removed the 3 LEDs for the Locks, because I dont use these functions and wanted a cleaner look (origina verison with LEDs is available)
- Removed the big Lightguide next to the encoder and replaced it with a 1mm hole for plastic lighfiber (not changed in original verison)
- Added a version with **4 degree typing angle**, instead of the 6.5 of the Original (both versions available)

## Printing
You need a printer capable of printing a **405mm** object. I had to slighlty increase the printarea of my 400mm Ratrig vCore3 in Software (x-Axis, does not work on y-Axis on the vCore)

## Hardware needed
- Printed Case (obviously)
- 8x M3x10 cylinder head screws (ISO 4762, button head work too) to connect the two case halfes 
- 10x M3x5 cylinder head screws (ISO 4762, button head work too) to mount the plate on the top case
- 18x M3x4mm threaded insert
- 4x 10mm feet

### for the original version
For the light pipe etc see the [original documentation](https://github.com/bluepylons/Boston/tree/master/Boston%20-%20Current%20design/Metal%20version).

### for the version without LEDs
- just ~1cm of plastic lightfiber (you have to drill the hole with a 1mm drill, it is printed smaller, for a better fit)
